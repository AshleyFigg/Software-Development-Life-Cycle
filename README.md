# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
As I experienced throughout the course about the different Scrum Roles, my personal favorite was Product Owner. As the Product Owner you are quite experienced in both business and technical to properly take needs of the user and implement them into Epics and User Stories for the rest of the team to start progrmming based off those needs. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
After learning various approaches to take when it comes developing whether it is waterfall methodology or scrum agile approach, it all depends on the project, demand, needs, and product deliverable. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work is the scrum mindset because it always me to have continous feedback throughout my development process. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
As a team member I need to understand what I need to do and why I am dloing it. As a team member I will create an open and safe environment where people feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns as a group. Being a good team member also means being upfront about our feelings and be quick to deal with issues.
